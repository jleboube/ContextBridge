# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
**Product Name:** ContextBridge (working title)  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Owner:** [Your Name / Company]  
**Date:** August 21, 2025

## 1. Executive Summary  
Generative AI tools are increasingly used for long-form projects (e.g., research, product development, coding, writing). However, current GenAI products are constrained by **context window limits** (tokens) and **platform silos** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), preventing smooth continuity across sessions and providers.  

**ContextBridge** solves this by creating a **persistent conversation memory system** that:  
- Saves and organizes AI conversation history.  
- Summarizes and condenses when necessary.  
- Allows seamless handoff between AI providers (e.g., start in ChatGPT, continue in Claude, finish in Gemini).  
- Enables users to treat all GenAI platforms as a unified workflow.  

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives  

### Goals  
- Allow users to **pick up where they left off** across different AI platforms.  
- Overcome token/context limits by using **summarization and compression** strategies.  
- Provide a **centralized project workspace** for AI-assisted tasks.  
- Build a **SaaS product** that can be sold to professionals, students, and teams.  

### Non-Goals  
- Competing directly with LLM providers.  
- Training or hosting our own foundational model (we integrate, not compete).

## 3. Key Features  

### 3.1 Core Features  
1. **Conversation Capture & Storage**  
   - Store raw chat logs (with metadata: timestamps, AI provider, version, etc.).  
   - Allow tagging, search, and project-based organization.  

2. **Context Summarization Engine**  
   - AI-powered summarizer to condense long chats into digestible context.  
   - User can choose level of compression (e.g., high detail vs. executive summary).  
   - Automatic chunking for token-limit compatibility.  

3. **Cross-Platform Continuity**  
   - Export/import conversation state into supported AI providers.  
   - Pre-pend relevant context as "conversation memory" for a new AI session.  
   - Allow user to switch providers mid-project.  

4. **Project Workspaces**  
   - Each project = multiple conversations across providers.  
   - Track evolution of ideas, drafts, and outputs.  
   - Timeline/history view.  

5. **User Controls**  
   - Edit summaries before passing to next AI.  
   - Manually prune or select what to carry forward.  
   - Export project archive (Markdown, JSON, PDF).  

### 3.2 Advanced Features (Future)  
- **AI Style Calibration:** Retain “voice” or instructions across providers (e.g., humor, formal tone).  
- **Team Collaboration:** Shared project workspaces with multi-user editing.  
- **API Integration:** Plug directly into OpenAI/Anthropic APIs to automate context passing.  
- **Plugin Ecosystem:** Allow third-party extensions (e.g., for Notion, Slack, Jupyter).

## 4. User Stories  

- *As a researcher,* I want to summarize a 100-page chat with GPT-4 and continue seamlessly in Claude.  
- *As a developer,* I want to transfer my AI-assisted codebase brainstorming from ChatGPT to Gemini without losing prior discussions.  
- *As a writer,* I want to maintain character/plot consistency across multiple AI tools.  
- *As a consultant,* I want a workspace that records and organizes AI-assisted deliverables for clients.

## 5. Competitive Landscape  
- **ChatGPT Memory (OpenAI):** Limited to within one provider.  
- **Anthropic Claude Projects:** Offers memory within Anthropic ecosystem only.  
- **Perplexity AI:** Provides summaries, but not cross-provider handoff.  
- **Notion/Obsidian Plugins:** Store text but lack AI context handoff optimization.  

**Differentiator:** ContextBridge is **agnostic** — designed to unify multiple AI providers and break the silos.

## 6. Technical Requirements  

### 6.1 Architecture  
- **Frontend:**  
  - Web-based dashboard (React + Tailwind).  
  - User authentication (OAuth, email/password).  
  - Rich text editor for project workspaces.  

- **Backend:**  
  - API server (Node.js / Python FastAPI).  
  - Secure storage (PostgreSQL + Vector DB for embeddings).  
  - Summarization & chunking engine (powered by LLMs).  

- **Integrations:**  
  - AI provider APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc.).  
  - Import/export in JSON/Markdown/PDF.  

- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Docker Compose deployment.  
  - Option for on-prem (enterprise).  
  - Cloud-hosted SaaS (AWS/GCP).  

### 6.2 Data Model  
- **Project** → contains multiple **Conversations** → contains **Messages** (raw + summarized).  
- **Context Chain:** Summary + embeddings for search and compression.  
- **User Controls:** Editable summaries, tagging.

## 7. Security & Compliance  
- Data encryption at rest and in transit.  
- SOC2-ready architecture for enterprise customers.  
- User choice: keep data local (self-hosted) or in cloud.  

---

## 8. Metrics & KPIs  
- **Adoption:** # of active projects per user.  
- **Engagement:** Average length of conversation chains.  
- **Retention:** % of users continuing multi-provider workflows.  
- **Revenue:** Conversion rate from free → paid tier.  

---
